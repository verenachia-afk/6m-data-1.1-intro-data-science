# **🎬 Case Study: The Netflix Data Engine**

## **The Scenario**

Netflix doesn't just show you movies; it predicts what you want before you know it. This recommendation system is a perfect example of the **Data Lifecycle**.

## **👥 Group Discussion Questions**

Break into small groups and answer the following. Use your knowledge of Structured vs. Unstructured data.

### **Part 1: Collection (What data do they have?)**

*List at least 3 examples for each category that Netflix likely collects about you:*

* **Explicit Data (Things you click):** (e.g., Thumbs up/down...)
* 1. Completed videos
  2. Videos scrolled pass
  3. Skipped introduction / skip portion of the video 
* **Implicit Data (Things you do):** (e.g., Did you pause at a scary scene? Did you binge-watch 5 episodes?)
* 1. Videos completed in the same genre - detective movies / romance drama / korean dramas
  2. Volume down at specific parts - action scenes / romantic scenes
  3. Rewind portions - begining of new drama / movie sequel recommended prequels

### **Part 2: Structured vs. Unstructured**

* **Structured Data:** User ID, Movie Genre, Release Year.
* 1. Duration of video
  2. Video language
  3. Available subtitles 
* **Unstructured Data:** The movie thumbnails (images), the movie plot summary (text), the video files themselves.  
  * *Question: How might Netflix use the **Unstructured** data (thumbnails) to trick you into watching a movie?*
  * Have a history of likely detective movies? Change thumbnails that are more mystery based or intriging

### **Part 3: The Algorithm (Analysis)**

* If User A watches "Breaking Bad" and "Better Call Saul".  
* And User B watches "Breaking Bad".  
* *What will the algorithm recommend to User B? Why?*
* If User A and B likes X, and only A likes Y, it's likely that B will like Y as well, therefore recommend Y 

### **Part 4: Ethics (The "Bubble")**

* *Is it ethical for an algorithm to only show you things it knows you will like? Does this create a 'content bubble' that limits your exposure to new ideas?*
* No, it means the user is only exposed to content that are similar and might get bored of similar concepts / movies. It's good to cater for that and periodically recommend something that does not fit the algorithm as much to expose the user to new concepts / styles.

**Part 1: Collection**

- **Explicit Data (things you click):** Thumbs up/down ratings, adding a show to "My List", the search terms you type, the profile/maturity settings you choose.
- **Implicit Data (things you do):** How long you watch before quitting, whether you binge 5 episodes in one night, what time of day you watch, whether you rewind or pause at certain scenes, which thumbnail finally made you click after scrolling past three times.

**Part 2: Structured vs. Unstructured — the thumbnail trick**

Netflix analyses its unstructured images to learn which *kind* of artwork makes *you* click. If you tend to watch romances, the same movie might be shown to you with a thumbnail of the couple; if you watch action, you'd see the explosion scene instead. Different users see different artwork for the same title — the unstructured data (images) is being mined to personalise the "packaging."

**Part 3: The Algorithm**

The algorithm will likely recommend **"Better Call Saul" to User B**. Why? Because User A and User B overlap (both watched "Breaking Bad"), so the system assumes their tastes are similar. This approach is called **collaborative filtering** — in plain English: *people who liked what you liked will probably like the same next thing — like asking a friend with similar taste for a movie tip*. The algorithm doesn't need to understand the shows at all; it just matches patterns of similar viewers.

**Part 4: Ethics — the "Bubble"**

There's no single right answer — good discussions usually surface both sides:

- *For:* Recommendations save time, reduce choice overload, and genuinely help people find things they enjoy.
- *Against:* If you're only ever shown what you already like, you're in a "content bubble" — your tastes narrow, new genres and viewpoints never reach you, and the platform's goal (keep you watching) may not match your goal (discover something meaningful). A strong answer also mentions possible fixes: injecting deliberate variety, "explore something new" rows, or giving users transparency and control over their recommendations.
